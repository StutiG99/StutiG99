With a degree in Quantitative Economics and Statistics & Data Science, I have built a strong foundation in leveraging data to inform policy and practice. My career spans roles in research, monitoring, and program evaluation across global and grassroots organizations such as J-PAL, Pratham Education Foundation, and the Central Square Foundation.

Through these roles, I have collaborated directly with diverse stakeholdersâ€”including beneficiaries, governments, bureaucrats, academics, and NGOsâ€”developing the ability to convene and translate ideas across groups, facilitating stakeholder alignment. I am dedicated to leveraging emerging technology and Indiaâ€™s evolving digital public infrastructure to transform program design and delivery, aiming to drive impactful and equitable solutions in the development sector.

These are some projects that I have worked on:
